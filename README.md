# London Bikes Project

## Overview

This project analyzes London's bike-sharing system using data from CSV files. The process involves storing the data in a database, cleaning it, removing unwanted information, and performing calculations to derive insights into bike usage patterns across the city. A Tableau dashboard was created to visualize these insights interactively.The analysis provides insights into:Popular bike-sharing routes, Peak usage hours and days,Factors influencing bike-sharing demand (e.g., weather, events).

## Project Structure

1. **Data Ingestion**: CSV files containing bike-sharing data are imported into a database.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Unwanted data is removed, and the dataset is cleaned for analysis.
3. **Data Processing**: Calculations and transformations are performed on the cleaned data.
4. **Analysis**: Insights are derived from the processed data.
5. **Visualization**: A Tableau dashboard is created to present the findings interactively.

## Key Features

- Database storage of bike-sharing data
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Calculation of usage metrics
- Interactive Tableau dashboard for visualization
- Analysis of bike-sharing trends

## Data Source

The project uses the London Bike-Share Usage Dataset, which contains detailed records of bicycle journeys from the Transport for London (TfL) Cycle Hire system.



The analysis provides insights into:

- Popular bike-sharing routes
- Peak usage hours and days
- Factors influencing bike-sharing demand (e.g., weather, events)
